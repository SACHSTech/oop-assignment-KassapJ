## Summary
### The system that I've demonstrated in my code is a simulation of a random pokemon battle. It functions pretty similar to an actual battle, featuring the actual equations for catching a pokemon. With 7 classes, my code will generate a random battle, 1-2 random trainers, a possible wild pokemon, 1-6 random pokemon for each trainer, 1-4 random moves for each pokemon, and each trainer will get a random amount of items they get to use. 

### The user will be allowed to input their name, amount of badges and what moves they want their pokemon to use. The user and the computer will battle each other until one of them loses, in which the program will finish.

### You can generate as many pokemon battles as you want, and you can call on them in the main class, which allows you to build an entire game and call on this battle to be used whenever you want.
